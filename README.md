# Queue Simulator
This is an assignment from one of my Uni course, Computational Method. It is built only using Freemat. 
### How it works
It queues N amount of cars and insert them into a queue systems to then be distribute to 3 wash bay whenever one is available. The generation of random arrival time and service time are using just the Rand() function from freemat and Linear Congruential method.
